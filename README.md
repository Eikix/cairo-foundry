## 🏗️ Architecture

![cairo-foundry](resources/img/architecture.png)

## 🎟️ Description

CairoFoundry is a blazingly fast toolkit for [Starknet](https://starknet.io/) application development. It is comprised of:

-   ✅ A testing framework 🦀
-   🗓️ (long-term plan) A modular CLI/SDK to interact with Starknet smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   🗓️ (long-term plan) A local Starknet node wrapper

The short-term goal is to build an efficient test runner for Cairo smart contract development in Rust. Good comparisons are Protostar test suite (written in Python, for Cairo) or - though less comparable - Jest (written in Javascript, for Javascript) and Pytest (written in Python, for Python).

## 🎗️ Prerequisites
